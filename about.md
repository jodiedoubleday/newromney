A Community Event, Revitalising Community Spirit

The New Romney Country Fayre is held annually on St Martin's Field and the Fairfield Road Recreation Ground in New Romney, which is just off the High Street. It is the largest free event on Romney Marsh, attracting over 7000 residents and visitors from all over the south east of England. The volunteer committee was originally set up in 1994 with the first Fayre taking place the following year. Since then the Fayre has grown into a huge attraction and has helped to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for local organisations and charities who take part in the event.

The Country Fayre brings the whole community together and is all about promoting traditional family fun. It has become an event that the whole Town can be proud of.

There are 2 arenas offering a full day of entertainment, surrounded by stalls selling produce of all kinds, crafts, tombolas and games. The day kicks off with a noisy and colourful Parade through the Town leaving the Marsh Academy at 10.15am

**PLEASE NOTE THAT ROADS IN THE AREA WILL BE CLOSED TO ALLOW THE PARADE TO TAKE PLACE**

We apologise for this, but disruption will be kept to a minimum

If you want to leave your car at home and go green why not travel on the Romney Hythe Dymchurch Railway. Their special trains will arrive in New Romney in time for the start of the Parade. Special fares apply. For more information visit [Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway](http://www.rhdr.org.uk)

## Be part of the team

All the organisation of the Fayre is carried out by a team of less than 15 volunteers. As the event continues to grow, the Committee always welcomes new members. No special skills are needed, just lots of enthusiasm and a willingness to be involved. Meetings take place once a month and are held at The Broadacre in North Street.

Some of the jobs our volunteers do include:

* Acting as Parade Marshals

* Setting up Road Closures for the Parade

* Running the Refreshment Stall on the day

* Selling Programmes

* Helping with the setting up and clearing away of Country Fayre equipment

* Helping to sell advertising space in our programme

* Booking arena entertainment

* Helping with fundraising events

If you feel you could spare some time to help with the organisation and preparations or want to help out on the day itself, then please call the Chairman on: 01797 363981

## Awards in 2016

Our Committee Members, past and present were recently awarded New Romney Town Council's "PRIDE OF NEW ROMNEY" award and we were then nominated for a Kent Association of Local Councils Award, which much to our surprise we won. This prestigious award was won against many other nominations from around Kent.

The award was presented by the Chairman of KALC, Raymond Evision, to our Committee Chairman, Frances Wire at the New Romney Town Council Mayor Making ceremony in May.

As a Committee we feel very honoured to be recognised by not only the Town Council, but also by the Kent wide KALC and are very proud to accept both of these awards.

The wording on the certificate reads: "For 22 years a dedicated committee of volunteers have organised an annual free community event attended by several thousand people.  Their work benefits charities, supports local businesses and promotes New Romney"
