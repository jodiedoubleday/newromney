Would you like to support the 2018 Country Fayre?

The cost of staging the event is in the region of £11,000. It is not only the arena acts that cost the money, although nearly half of the total is spent on performers. The remainder is used for essential services such as hire of toilets, PA system, rubbish skips, public liability insurance, first aid cover and the purchase of new equipment and replacement of anything broken or worn out. Every year there are new health and safety requirements, which often necessitate the purchase or hiring of additional equipment.

Any form of help is always most welcome, be it logistical such as loan of a van or equipment, selling of programmes, acting as parade marshals and help with the setting up of the Fayre and the clearing up following the event.
