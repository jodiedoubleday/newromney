> We were so gutted for you about the rain in the afternoon, such a disappointment after all the hard work you put in to organising the Fayre.  It really was a super event and the morning turnout was fantastic.

> Having only recently moved to the area this was our first New Romney Country Fayre experience.  The Parade was a great start to the day, charming uplifting with terrific music.  With so many performers, activities and stalls there really was something for everyone.  It was such a shame that the weather intervened but we are already looking forward to next year's event.  Hats off to everybody involved.  A remarkable showcase of the community spirit, opportunities and talents of New Romne.
