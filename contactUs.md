## Comments received following the 2019 Fayre

An enormous "thank you" for celebrating 25 years of New Romney Country Fayre in such a special way.  For me it was a very special and memorable day - seeing so many old friends.  Most importantly huge thanks to you all for continuing NRCF in splendid style.  - **Carole Waters who originally came up with the idea of having a Country Fayre**

My sincere thanks to you all for giving me the privilege of opening the Country Fayre.  It made me feel very proud to think it is 25 years since it started.  It is thanks to people like yourselves who have worked tirelessly to make it the success it is today.  - **Shirley Carey **

We had several positive comments about the sound system.  The comment from Xtreme Falconry was "we do many large shows and often have problems with the radio mics - by far this is the best.          **Kent PA Hire**
