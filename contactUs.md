## Comments received following the 2017 Fayre

> A great day, a real community event.
>
> Terrific atmosphere in the High Street and a real buzz on the field.
>
> We were so gutted for you about the rain in the afternoon, such a disappointment after all the hard work you put in to organising the Fayre.  It really was a super event and the morning turnout was fantastic.
>
> The Fayre and the Parade seemed bigger than ever
>
> As usual you did a great job, a really lovely successful and fun-packed Country Fayre.  The Parade was fabulous.
>
> Despite the pouring rain we very much enjoyed our day and commend all the stall holders and entertainers who braved the wet for us mad people.
>
> It was lovely to see you all again.  We had a lovely day even with the rain
>
> Having only recently moved to the area this was our first New Romney Country Fayre experience.  The Parade was a great start to the day, charming uplifting with terrific music.  With so many performers, activities and stalls there really was something for everyone.  It was such a shame that the weather intervened but we are already looking forward to next year's event.  Hats off to everybody involved.  A remarkable showcase of the community spirit, opportunities and talents of New Romne.
