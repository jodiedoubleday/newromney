    <h1>Support Us</h1>
    <p>Would you like to support the 2018 Country Fayre?</p>

<p>The cost of staging the event is in the region of £11,000. It is not only the arena acts that cost the money, although nearly half of the total is spent on performers. The remainder is used for essential services such as hire of toilets, PA system, rubbish skips, public liability insurance, first aid cover and the purchase of new equipment and replacement of anything broken or worn out. Every year there are new health and safety requirements, which often necessitate the purchase or hiring of additional equipment.</p>

<p>Any form of help is always most welcome, be it logistical such as loan of a van or equipment, selling of programmes, acting as parade marshals and help with the setting up of the Fayre and the clearing up following the event.</p>

<p>A Community Event, Revitalising Community Spirit</p>

<p>The New Romney Country Fayre is held annually on St Martin’s Field and the Fairfield Road Recreation Ground in New Romney, which is just off the High Street. It is the largest free event on Romney Marsh, attracting over 7000 residents and visitors from all over the south east of England. The volunteer committee was originally set up in 1994 with the first Fayre taking place the following year. Since then the Fayre has grown into a huge attraction and has helped to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for local organisations and charities who take part in the event.</p>

<p>The Country Fayre brings the whole community together and is all about promoting traditional family fun. It has become an event that the whole Town can be proud of.</p>

<p>There are 2 arenas offering a full day of entertainment, surrounded by stalls selling produce of all kinds, crafts, tombolas and games. The day kicks off with a noisy and colourful Parade through the Town leaving the Marsh Academy at 10.15am</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT ROADS IN THE AREA WILL BE CLOSED TO ALLOW THE PARADE TO TAKE PLACE</strong></p>

<p>We apologise for this, but disruption will be kept to a minimum</p>

<p>If you want to leave your car at home and go green why not travel on the Romney Hythe Dymchurch Railway. Their special trains will arrive in New Romney in time for the start of the Parade. Special fares apply. For more information visit <a href="http://www.rhdr.org.uk">Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway</a></p>

<h2 id="be-part-of-the-team">Be part of the team</h2>

<p>All the organisation of the Fayre is carried out by a team of less than 15 volunteers. As the event continues to grow, the Committee always welcomes new members. No special skills are needed, just lots of enthusiasm and a willingness to be involved. Meetings take place once a month and are held at The Broadacre in North Street.</p>

<p>Some of the jobs our volunteers do include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Acting as Parade Marshals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Setting up Road Closures for the Parade</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running the Refreshment Stall on the day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Selling Programmes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helping with the setting up and clearing away of Country Fayre equipment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helping to sell advertising space in our programme</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Booking arena entertainment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helping with fundraising events</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel you could spare some time to help with the organisation and preparations or want to help out on the day itself, then please call the Chairman on: 01797 363981</p>

<h2 id="awards-in-2016">Awards in 2016</h2>

<p>Our Committee Members, past and present were recently awarded New Romney Town Council’s “PRIDE OF NEW ROMNEY” award and we were then nominated for a Kent Association of Local Councils Award, which much to our surprise we won. This prestigious award was won against many other nominations from around Kent.</p>

<p>The award was presented by the Chairman of KALC, Raymond Evision, to our Committee Chairman, Frances Wire at the New Romney Town Council Mayor Making ceremony in May.</p>

<p>As a Committee we feel very honoured to be recognised by not only the Town Council, but also by the Kent wide KALC and are very proud to accept both of these awards.</p>

<p>The wording on the certificate reads: “For 22 years a dedicated committee of volunteers have organised an annual free community event attended by several thousand people.  Their work benefits charities, supports local businesses and promotes New Romney”</p>

  <p>We were so gutted for you about the rain in the afternoon, such a disappointment after all the hard work you put in to organising the Fayre.  It really was a super event and the morning turnout was fantastic.</p>

  <p>Having only recently moved to the area this was our first New Romney Country Fayre experience.  The Parade was a great start to the day, charming uplifting with terrific music.  With so many performers, activities and stalls there really was something for everyone.  It was such a shame that the weather intervened but we are already looking forward to next year’s event.  Hats off to everybody involved.  A remarkable showcase of the community spirit, opportunities and talents of New Romne.</p>

<p>Despite the best efforts of the weather, the 2017 Fayre was a huge success.  The Parade was fantastic, all the entrants had made so much effort with their costumes for our theme of Children’s Books and it was probably the largest Parade ever.  This was the first time in 23 years that the Fayre had to be curtailed because of bad weather. If it had stayed fine, it would probably have been a record breaking day.
The New Romney Country Fayre is an annual event held on St Martin’s Field and the Fairfield Road Recreation Ground in New Romney. It is the largest free event on Romney Marsh and is a true community event attracting over 7,000 visitors from all over the South East of England. The original Committee was formed in 1994 with the first Fayre taking place the following year. Since then it has grown into a massive event and has helped to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for local organisations and charities who take part. For map please see <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>
A real highlight of the day is the vibrant and colourful parade through the High Street to St Martin’s Field for the Official Opening. A programme of all-day entertainment in two arenas then follows.
As well as free entry to the Fayre a free car park is provided in Ashford Road. Alternatively, go green and catch one of the special trains being run from Romney Sands and Hythe, by the Romney Hythe and Dymchurch Railway. These trains will arrive in New Romney in time for you to see the Parade.  We are pleased to be working again with the RHDR and details of trains, special fares and timetables can be found on their website: <a href="http://www.rhdr.org.uk">Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway</a>

<p>Would you like to support the 2018 Country Fayre?</p>

<p>The cost of staging the event is in the region of £11,000. It is not only the arena acts that cost the money, although nearly half of the total is spent on performers. The remainder is used for essential services such as hire of toilets, PA system, rubbish skips, public liability insurance, first aid cover and the purchase of new equipment and replacement of anything broken or worn out. Every year there are new health and safety requirements, which often necessitate the purchase or hiring of additional equipment.</p>

<p>Any form of help is always most welcome, be it logistical such as loan of a van or equipment, selling of programmes, acting as parade marshals and help with the setting up of the Fayre and the clearing up following the event.</p>
