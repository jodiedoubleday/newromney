<h2 id="comments-received-following-the-2019-fayre">Comments received following the 2019 Fayre</h2>

<p>An enormous “thank you” for celebrating 25 years of New Romney Country Fayre in such a special way.  For me it was a very special and memorable day - seeing so many old friends.  Most importantly huge thanks to you all for continuing NRCF in splendid style.  - <strong>Carole Waters who originally came up with the idea of having a Country Fayre</strong></p>

<p>My sincere thanks to you all for giving me the privilege of opening the Country Fayre.  It made me feel very proud to think it is 25 years since it started.  It is thanks to people like yourselves who have worked tirelessly to make it the success it is today.  - **Shirley Carey **</p>

<p>We had several positive comments about the sound system.  The comment from Xtreme Falconry was “we do many large shows and often have problems with the radio mics - by far this is the best.          <strong>Kent PA Hire</strong></p>

<p>We were pleased to help your hardworking Committee with litter picking after a very long day.</p>

<p>Despite the weather it was another great day.  -  <strong>Romney Marsh Litter Picking Group</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for inviting us to the Country Fayre, the Cadets really enjoyedd themselves and even the rain didn’t stop that.  We look forward to coming next year -  <strong>Ashford Volunteer Police Cadets</strong></p>

<p>The Parade was** <strong>larger than ever</strong> <strong>and went well despite the drizzle.  Crowds were not put off and stayed all day.  Once again, the success of the day was due to your great organisation and a real credit to the hard work you carry out during the year.  -  **Kent Greyhound Rescue</strong></p>

<p>There was a fantastic atmosphere throughout the day.  -  <strong>Local Resident</strong></p>

<p>We had a great day and enjoyed watching the fabulous entertainment between our sets.  We look forward to our next performance on The Marsh - <strong>Member of the Sheppey St John Ambulance Band</strong></p>

<p>Thank you.  Many of our guests commented on the great community spirit and I wanted to make sure this was passed on to you and the team.  Thanks for a great day  -  <strong>Mayoress of New Romney</strong></p>

<p>As ever it was indeed a pleasure to be able to contribute to your event.  We will of course look forward to next year.  -  <strong>Squire, Woodchurch Morris Men</strong></p>

<p>A shame about the weather, but a wonderful community spirit  -  <strong>Stall Holder</strong></p>
