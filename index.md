**THE 2019 COUNTRY FAYRE WILL BE HELD ON SATURDAY 27TH JULY**

The New Romney Country Fayre is an annual event held on St Martin's Field and the Fairfield Road Recreation Ground in New Romney. It is the largest free event on Romney Marsh and is a true community event attracting over 7,000 visitors from all over the South East of England. The original Committee was formed in 1994 with the first Fayre taking place the following year. Since then it has grown into a massive event and has helped to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for local organisations and charities who take part. For map please see [contact us](/contact/)

**THIS YEAR WE ARE CELEBRATING 25 YEARS OF THE NEW ROMNEY COUNTRY FAYRE**

A real highlight of the day is the vibrant and colourful parade through the High Street to St Martin's Field for the Official Opening.   The theme for the 2019 Parade is English Country Garden.  Following the Parade and Official Opening there will be a full programme of all-day entertainment in two arenas. 

As well as free entry to the Fayre a free car park is provided in Ashford Road. Alternatively, go green and catch one of the special trains being run from Romney Sands and Hythe Stations, by the Romney Hythe and Dymchurch Railway. These trains will arrive in New Romney in time for you to see the Parade.  We are pleased to be working again with the RHDR and details of trains, special fares and timetables can be found on the website of the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway:  www.rhdr.org.uk
