**THE 2020 COUNTRY FAYRE WILL BE HELD ON SATURDAY 25TH JULY **\
Planning for this year's New Romney Country Fayre are already well in hand and we hope that this year the weather will be kind to us.

The Fayre will start at 10.00am withe Official Opening at 11.15am and will run until 5.00pm with entertainment in two arenas.  Again there will be some old favourites, together with some new acts, which we hope will be enjoyed by all.  

The Parade will be at 10.15am from the Lower Car Park at The Marsh Academy and the theme will be Nursery Rhymes to coincide with the 200th Anniversary of New Romney Old School.  This building plays a very important part in the life of New Romney, not only does it hold many old artifacts, old school registers and an annual exhibition based on local events, but there are also rooms to rent.  Therefore the Country Fayre Committee want to support the Old School in its 200th year.

We look forward to seeing you all at this Community Annual event.
