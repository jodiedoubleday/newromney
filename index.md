As the 2020 has had to be cancelled we have decided to hold a Virtual Fayre on Saturday, 25th July.

We are asking the community to take part by dressing up for the Parade, or recreating an act in their gardens, then sending us pictures and we will put these on to our Facebook page.  Anyone can take part, we are happy to have photographs or videos and would love to receive messages from you.

A Great Virtual Cream Tea will take place in gardens around the Town at 3.30pm on the Saturday and it would be good if gardens were decorated with bunting to celebrate the occasion.  Send us your pictures/clips and these too will be put on to the Facebook page.

Some of the acts booked for 2020 have sent us things that we will be featuring on the day.

Please send all photographs/videos to each of the following, who will be collating them ready for publication:

E-mail:

caroline.wire@btinternet.com\
kirstenaterry@gmail.com\
blackadder1@btinternet.com

Please support our Virtual Fayre in any way that you can so that this great event is not forgotten.  It will be back next year on Saturday, 31st July and we look forward to seeing you all again then.

Many thanks, we await your photos and videos.
