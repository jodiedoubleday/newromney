We are extremely sorry to announce that we have had to cancel the 2021 New Romney Country Fayre, scheduled for Saturday, 31st July.

Although we had hoped to be able to stage the event in some form this year, the advice we have received this week from the Safety Advisory Group and NHS England is that the date falls too close to the lifting of Covid restrictions on 21st June.  Therefore, permission for the staging of the Fayre would not be granted due to concerns surrounding social distancing and control of visitor numbers.

All our Committee Members are very disappointed and sad to have to cancel the Country Fayre for the second year in succession, but, as responsible event organisers, we have to put the health and safety of our community, volunteers and participants first.

We will be contacting all those who have made financial contributions towards the year's Fayre in due course to offer refunds or to ask if they would like to have stall desposits, donations, etc rolled over to 2022.

The date of the 2022 New Romney Country Fayre will be **SATURDAY, 30TH JULY.**

All being well we will be back next year to once again stage an event that the whole community can be proud of.

**New Romney Country Fayre Committee**
