**ENTERTAINMENT FOR 2018 FAYRE**\
All the acts have now been booked for 2018 and include our local youth bands and dance groups.  We particularly like to give them the opportunity to perform so that they can show the public what they can do.  The very popular X-treme Falconry will be back with us and The Blue Falcon Gymnastic Display Team, who got rained off last year, will be showing the crowds their fantastic skills.  Something not to be missed.

The Southern Golden Retrievers Display Team,  who were with us two years ago will be making a welcome return and new for 2018 we have Pedal Power vs Parkour, which we hope the audience will enjoy.
