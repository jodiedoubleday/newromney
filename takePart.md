## Stalls

Stalls are run by charity groups, High Street traders, local organisations and businesses, as well as individuals. There is always a huge demand for stalls and we try to bring as much variety as we possibly can.

Types of stalls include:

* Local Produce
* Crafts
* Displays
* Traditional games such as Bat the Rat, Hook a Duck and Tombolas

To apply for a stall, or for further information, please contact our Stalls Co-ordinator by telephone: **01797 369230** and give details of the type of stall you wish to have i.e. craft, food, tombola etc or send an e-mail to:  **sylviascooper@aol.com.**

We are particularly looking for some more unusual stalls, as the allocation of food stalls is almost complete.  

Stall Holders are expected to be set up by 9am and vehicles removed from the site as **Fairfield Road will be closed from Mabledon Close to the Ashford Road junction from 9.00 am to 5.00 pm. **

_PLEASE NOTE THAT NEW ROMNEY IS ON THE SOUTH EAST COAST OF KENT AND WE RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE APPLYING FOR A STALL LIVES WITHIN A 30 MILE RADIUS AS THE TRAFFIC CAN BE EXTREMELY HEAVY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS._
